You can develop your mobile app on Xamarin Forms platform and have the same capabilities of a native app, for mobile push functionalities. For more information about using the Xamarin Forms SDK on top of your iOS and Android platforms, see the [Xamarin documentation in IBM Knowledge Center](https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/en/SSMRK7_3.0.0/AppPush/xamarin_container.html).
